This is the repository for the Big Data - Next Gen 05/31/2022 curriculum. The notes are separated by week and then by topic, and you can see all assignments, project guidelines, and other useful resources here once they are ready.
DO NOT PUSH ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO THIS REPO, unless I say it is fine. This is purely for saving lecture notes and assignments. Any notes or changes you yourself make should be kept to yourself.
