##Let's Practice with Linux Commands.

1. Create a new directory called 'Linux-Activity'
2. Create a file in that folder called 'NewFile.txt'
3. Populate that file with the following text: 'Learning Linux is fun'
4. Display that text on the command line
5. Make a directory in 'Linux-Activity' called 'Test-dir'
6. Move 'NewFile.txt' into 'Test-dir'
7. Change directory to 'Test-dir'
8. Rename the 'NewFile.txt' to 'File2.txt'
9. Change all permissions of 'File2.txt' to read, write, and execute
10. Check the file permissions
11. Change the 'other' permissions of File2.txt to read and write only
12. Copy 'File2.txt' to the parent folder
13. Delete 'test-dir' directory
14. Enter a text editor for 'File2.txt'
15. While in INSERT mode, enter these lines anywhere in the file:

'Linux is much better than Windows and Mac'
'This line was added using a text editor'
'I learned about Linux on Wednesday'
'We will have a QC some day next week'

16. Save the file and exit the text editor
17. Print the lines of text in 'File2.txt' in alphabetical order
18. Print all the lines of 'File2.txt' that contain 'Linux'
19. Enter a text editor for 'File2.txt' and copy any line of text
20. Put the copied line anywhere else in the file
21. Delete a line of text that is different than the one that was copied
22. Place the deleted line at the very top of the file
23. Save the file and exit the text editor
24. Print all lines of 'File2.txt' that contain 'day'
25. Delete the 'Linux-Activity' folder and all files within it
