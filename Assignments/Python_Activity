1. Write a python function that will calculate the square root of a user input integer passed to it.

2. Write a python function that creates the following list, and then prints each element of the list combined as a single string:
    ["Learning", "Python", "is", "fun."]

3. Write a python function that first creates a dictionary with the structure shown below, then takes 5 user inputs (listed below), and lastly puts them into the dictionary:

    inputs = "Bob", "Ross", "5-23-1949", "University of Pennsylvania", 1973

    dict = {

        "Last Name": ""
        "Date Of Birth" : ""
        "Secondary School": ""
        "Graduation Year": ""
    }

4. Write a python function that takes a user input and determines if the information has already been stored into the dictionary above.

5. Write a python function that takes a user input integer, and creates a list that is filled with all of those numbers multiplied by 2. (hint: use a for loop)
    Ex. user_input = 5 --> list = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
        user_input = 9 --> list = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

6. Write a python function that takes 10 user input numbers, and finds the maximum value among them.
