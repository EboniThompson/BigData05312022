Git
The tool to interact with GitHub and perform version control

Terminology:
'Branch' - A branch off the main 'trunk' that will not commit changes to the main.
'Merge' - combining the codes from different branches or different versions into the main working program.

Git commands:
-git pull: grabs the respository from GitHub and copies it to your local computer.
-git add: puts the files and changes made into the repository.
-git commit: saves the additions and changes made into the local.
-git push: copies the local repository into the cloud repo.

When you do git commit -m: create a commit message
-It is a good habit to write a commit message at all times so that yourself and other group members can keep track of changes in the project more conveniently.
