##Fundamentals:

What is Big Data?
- Big Data is A LOT of data.
- Traditional systems and tools are not capable of handling such amounts of data effectively.
- Can take a long time to analyze data to come to fully informed decisions.
- Big Data is a Solution that allows for faster decision making.

The Five 'V's of Big Data:
1. Volume - amount of data (scope in the Terrabytes and Petabytes (1000 TB))
2. Variety - different formats, different sizes, different qualities, different types of data
3. Value - how valuable is the information of data, there is a continuous flow of data
4. Velocity - handle and accumulate a lot of data frequently
5. Veracity - Reliability and Certainty of data according to verifiable quality checks

Types of Data:
Structured Data 
- defined format and size.
- You can use the patterns of the data in order to analyze efficiently
- Ex. Social security: ###-##-####

Semi-Structured Data
- defined structure, but variable size.
- Ex. Text file

Quasi-Structured Data
- no defined format but you can manipulate it into a usable format
- Ex. Clickstream data

Unstructured Data
- data without structure, format, or size definition.
- roughly 80% of all data that gets accumulated
- Ex. Word document, PDF, video file

Examples of Big Data in industry:
Youtube collects clickstream information to promote certain advertisements
Netflix recommends shows that are succeeding over those that are failing
Banks hold records for all of their patrons' accounts and every transaction that occurs

How to handle all this data?

1. Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
- Organize data into a schema to make it useful for analysis.
- This training course uses MySQL.
- Good for structured data.

2. Content Management system
- Data is held in a separate location such as cloud-based storage.
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 storage.
- Good for unstructured data.

Components of Big Data:

Follow steps of ETL
Extract, Transform, Load
Extract - get data from designated source
Transform - put the data into a usable form to perform analysis
Load - put the transformed data into a system that allow you to analyze and query.

Lifecycle of Data:
Creation > Collection > Processing > Storage > Management > Analysis > Visualization > Interpretation

Collection:
- grab the data, requires a planned approach to address the different kinds of data that may come in.
Processing and Storage:
- data is made homogenous and stored in a place that is safe and nonvolatile.
Analysis:
- data gets sent through different tools to be analyzed to create usable, valuable information.
Visualization and Interpretation:
- data and analyses are presented officially in a human-readable way, often with charts and graphs.
