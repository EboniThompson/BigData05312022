##Fundamentals:

Big Data is A LOT of data.
Traditional systems are not capable of handling such amounts of data.

Big Data 5 Vs
Volume - a lot 
Variety - different formats, different sizes, different qualities
Value - how valuable is the information of data
Velocity - handle a lot of data frequently
Veracity - Reliability and value of data.

Examples:
Youtube clickstream information
Netflix recommend shows that are succeeding over those are failing

Types of Data
Structured Data - defined format and size.
You can use the patterns of the data in order to analyze effiiently
Ex. Social security: ###-##-####

Semi-Structured Data - defined structure, but variable size.
Ex. Text file

Quasi-Structured Data - no defined format but you can manipulate it into a usable format
Ex Clickstream data

Unstructured Data - data without structure, format, or size definition.
roughly 85 % of all data that exists
Ex. Word document, PDF, video file

How to handle all this data?

1. Relational Databases RDBMS
Organize data into a structure to make it useful for analysis.
This class uses MySQL.
Good for structured data.

2. Content Manageemtn system
Data is held in a separate location to be stored.
Amazon Web Services S3 storage
Good for unstructured data.

Components of Big Data:

Follow steps of ETL
Extract, Transform, Load
Extract - get data from designated source
Transform - put the data into a usable form to perform analysis
Load - put the transformed data into a system that allow you to analyze and query.

Ingestion - grab the data, requires a plan.
Storage - data is secured in a place that is safe and nonvolatile
Analysis - data gets sent through different tools in order to be processed into usable, valuable information.
Consumption - data and analyses are presented officially in a human-readable.
