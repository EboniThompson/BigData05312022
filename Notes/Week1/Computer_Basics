##Computer basics

Processor:
The brain of the computer
Performs the work that you ask it to
Processor Cores allow computer to function and perform tasks

Operating System (OS):
- Gives humans the ability to interact with computers.
- Windows, Mac, Linux

Virtual machine:
- Creates virtual resources to perform different functions that the computer would not be able to do iteslf.
- Able to run another OS, such as Linux
- Resources are allocated from the actual hardwareto run a VM

Memory:
RAM:
- Random Access memory.
- The ability of the computer to do work.
- Short-term memory (gets discarded after the program stops running).
- Faster access.
Disk  (HDD, SSD)
- Storage for the computer.
- Long-term memory (saved as files in the system).
- Slower access.

Cluster:
- A network of computers that work together as a single unit.
Node:
- A single computer in a Cluster

Binaries:
- applications that can be run
- typically located in a 'bin' folder.
- written in Machine code which can be compiled by the processor

Kernel:
- The core of an OS.
- Controls all tasks of the system.
- Organizes and manages all data and processes.

Shell/Terminal/Command Line Interface (CLI):
- Interface that allows interaction with the kernel
