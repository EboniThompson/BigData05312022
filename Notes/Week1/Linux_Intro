Two main directories:
Home: ~
    - Where all of your personal files are stored
Root: /
    - Topmost file in the computer hierarchy

Permissions:

drwxrwxrwx
drw-rw-r--
d110110100
This is a binary representation
rwx = 111
4 + 2 + 1 = 7
Binary is like our decimal system (0-9) except each digit is a power of 2 instead of 10
11001 =/= eleven thousand and one
11001 = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^0 = 16 + 8 + 1 = 25

Each set of three refers to a different user
First set is the Owner
Second is Group
Third is Other (meaning all other users)
r - read
w - write
x - execute

chmod - change moderation / permissions

chmod 744 (give read privileges to all)
chmod 253 owner = write, group = read, execute, other = write and execute
chmod g-r (remove read privileges from group)

File Editors:
- 2 main file editors:
    nano
    vim (vi)

$ vi file_name
