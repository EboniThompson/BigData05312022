##Cloud Computing

A virtual service that gives the user computing power, storage, and elastic functions.
Amazon Web Serices
Azure
Dropbox
Google Cloud Platform

Problems with local computing:
1. Companies need to invest their own resources into servers, computers, etc.
2. Costs a lot of money.
3. Risk of not enough resources or wasted money on unused resources.
4. Limited collaboration capability

Cloud Computing exists to alleviate these costs and risks.
On-demand payment and use.
Elastic = change the computing power/storage/etc. as needed.

4 Types of Cloud Platforms
1. Private Cloud - used by a company who doesn't want their resources to be utilized for public uses.
2. Public Cloud - Accessible by the public for all sorts of different functions.
3. Hybrid Cloud - Mix of both Private and Public.
4. Multi-Cloud - have both public and private clouds to disperse reosources more efficiently and potentially save money.

Different functions that a cloud is capable of offering (*aaS)
- Let's use a House analogy
IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
    - Gives the user the ability to access physical and virtual servers, storage systems, networking, re-configure things to their liking
    - Access to the house blueprints, can change or alter what the houes is capable of doing
PaaS - Platform as a Service
    - On-demand access to cloud-hosted applications
    - Develop, run, and configure programs, store data, maintain and manage applications
    - Access to the house functions, able to utilize everything the houes currently offers
SaaS - Software as a Service
    - On-demand, ready to use software.
    - Access individual rooms of the house and rent them out individually
FaaS - Function as a Service
    - Still new in development
    - Only utilize specific functions of an application as they are needed.
    - Rent out only certain appliances like the toaster or refrigerator.

AWS - Amazon Web Services
- Publicly released in 2004
    Functions:
        1. Short-term and long-term data storage
        2. Elastic computing resources
        3. Data management systems
        4. Big Data analysis
        5. Adaptible to company needs
- has over 200 general-purpose services
    S3 - Storage
    EC2 - elastic computing
    DBS - Cloud Databases
    EMR - Elastic Mapreduce

AWS Structure
Divided into regions
    - Cluster of data centers in a specific area of the world
    - us-east-2
    - Select a region based on a few criteria
        1. Pricing
        2. Local and company law
        3. Services they provide
        4. Proximity
    - Regions are divided Availability Zones
        - One or more data centers that contain redundant information
        - Redundancy creates fault tolerance
        - 2-6 Availability Zones per region
    - Edge Locations
        - Data center or Point of presence
        - Over 300 of them worldwide
        - 84 Availability Zones across 42 Countries
        - Data Center locations are often remote

Amazon S3 - Simple Storage Service
- Cloud storage tool
- Very strong data durability (99.999999%)
- Offers multiple different types of storage depending on access and price
- Store "objects" in "buckets" (like files in a directory)
- A bucket must have a unique name
    3-63 characters
    No underscores, capital letters
    Ex. my-bucket5
    s3://my-bucket5/my-object
    s3://my-bucket5/Subdirectory/my-object

S3 Storage Options:
- S3 Standard
    - General Purpose Storage
    - On-demand access
- S3 Standard Infrequent Access
    - cheaper than Standard
    - minimum storage time
    - good for backup storage
- S3 One-Zone IA
    - Only accessible from ONE availability zone
    - cheaper than IA
    - good for data that is easy to replace
- S3 Glacier
    - Very long-term storage
    - minimum storage time 90 days
    - cheaper than IA
    - takes more time to retrieve data
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive
    - VEEEERY long-term storage
    - minimum storage time 180 days
    - cheaper than Glacier
    - Takes significantly longer to retrieve data

Encryption
- A means of keeping data inaccessible to people who might have unauthorized access
- Works off a cipher to scramble text
- Ex. ABC -> DEF
- The cipher is determined by the Encryption key
- Two types of Encryption
    1. Server-Side Encryption
        - AWS Encrypts the data and amanges the Keys
    2. Client-Side Encryption
        - Client manually encrypts data and keeps the key before sending info to the cloud

EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute
- Provides adaptible, resizable computing power
- Based on what are called "Instances"
- Upload a program to an EC2 instance, and the instance will run until you ask it to stop.
- EC2 Consists of:
    1. Virtual Machine
    2. Storage data 
    3. Auto-scaling
- Pricing:
    Spot Instance: 
    - send a request for computing power, price, and availazibility zone
    - Request is fulfilled by Amazon when the space becomes available
    Reserved Instance:
    - Pay a little more to reserve comuting capacity over a period of time
    - Must pay for the capacity for as long as it is reserved
    - last up to 3 years
    Dedicated Host:
    - Physical server that contains EC2 instance capacity completely uner your control
    - make sure it addresses compliance with company/ local policy
    - Save money on licensing costs
    On-Demand Instance:
    - EC2 is run on a private cloud for a single customer
    - physically isolated to keep it safe from outsiders

    Creating an EC2 Instance in Free Tier
    1. Go to AWS Management Console
    2. Search for EC2
    3. Click on "Instances" on the left-hand side
    4. Click the Orange "Launch Instance" button
    5. It may prompt you to "Opt out to the old experience." If it does, do that.
    6. Choose Amazon Linux 2 Kernel 5.10 AMI
    7. Choose Instance type t2.micro
    8. Click "Next: Configure Instance Details"
    9. Click "Next: Add Storage"
    10. Click "Next: Add tags"
    11. Click "Add tag" to give your Instance a name
    12. Click "Next: Configure Security Group"
    13. Click on the box under "Source" and change "Custom" to "My IP"
    14. Click "Add Rule", change Type to "HTTP", and Change source to "Anywhere"
    15. Click "Review and Launch"
    16. You will be prompted to download a private key file. DO NOT LOSE THIS FILE or you will never be able to access your EC2 Instance again.
    17. Click "Launch"
    18. Go back to Instances Page and refresh the page until you see Instance State: "Running"

    Terminating an Instance
    1. Go to AWS Management Console and go to EC2 Page
    2. Click the Instance ID of the Instance you wish to terminate
    3. Drop Down "Instance State" in the top right
    4. Choose "Terminate Instance"
    5. Click "Terminate"
